  <p>Dear lamah, </p>

  <p>
    I am writing this on 10th of April just to let you know that I am missing you too much. I have been remembering every possible way of spending time with you.
    I know its late, but yeah we dont have anything to reverse the time. I have been disconnecting myself from every socials I can just to make me live like 90s kids. I just missed to chat and just to see your shy smile. I do noticed you whenever my eyesight catch your movements. But the thing is I am afraid and lives in a fear of losing one more person from my life. My previous experience were really very bad in case of all my male friends or yk other relation with anyone close. No one stays at w me and at the end everyone just kicks me from their life and I think now the person im shaping in doesnt care about what others think about me. I have been becoming more strong and tough and i actually dont care about others, I do what makes me happy and I want to see everyone happy. If your question is *what about seeing yourself happy?* then the answer will probably take time , but im sure that i would be more happy with you  . The thing is I want to experience real time now , I made that mistake w you, I feel guilty about it and thats also one point that actually makes me lower than what you actually deserve. Currently, There are only 2-3 people in my list with whom I talk and spend time and others I just let my self talk with inner me. This sometimes sucks but there is no other way to handle it. I missed your last smile and I am really sorry of what I should have done but I couldnt. I couldnt make you realise what you actually deserve despite of being in this cruel and unkind world. I wanted to make you feel how special a person can be to another one. I really appreciate God as whenever I felt down, you just let my chin up and battle with the problems. Remember the 2023 summer holiday? We talked in call that day. I am so so so sorry, I was too underconfident and My english is englishing that day :( . I wanted to talk about many things share some of the tips and tricks I have been using but I couldn't . Once I promised to your brother that I will take care of you and help you whenver needed. But I couldnt kept the promise. I am a failure. I am a failure in my words. I am a failure in spending time with the loved ones. I am a failure in loving you. There will be always a special corner for you in my heart, and I promise - THE PINKY PROMISE i will keep it safe, Till we grow up. And now I feel ashame to talk to you. How to talk ? What to talk? everytime I just disappeared when the time is right. I am sorry I just couldnt make it. but you will be always remembered! And yes connections, I dont believe in it now . I am just scared to keep connection with anyone. My next 2  years , I will train myself to be more strong. To take full control on myself. To be a kind person and to make others happy (dont worry about me. Happiness is not for me.) 
    I just wish a good day and a good week prolly. I will be appearing someday just to let how my bbg doing hahaha
    Goodnight Naphung
    You will always be missed 
    And I manifest that someday we will spend our life together <
    I enjoyed every moment spend with you, every laughter, that exam scene, the library scene. 
    Take care of your health. and dont worry I am with you, I will be looking it :3 </p>
   <p> 
    Yours forever,
    Juman </p>
